This is a Distributed File Server and Client to access the code!
To run the server simply ensure that you have made the files using the command "make", then use the following commands to run the various servers:
./dfs /DFS1 10001 &
./dfs /DFS2 10002 &
./dfs /DFS3 10003 &
./dfs /DFS4 10004 &
You must be in the Servers Folder to run these!

To use the server open up the client directory, ensure the files are made using the command "make."
Then use the command: ./dfc dfc.conf to run the client! From there follow the instructions on the screen!
If you would like to change any of the client Configuration, please edit dfc.conf.

The Client implements very simple XOR encryption and stores files encrpyted on the server!
We also optimize traffic and only perform the GET once for each part of the file!

To change the authorized users, enter a name and password in name:password format into dfs.conf!
An example user could be joe:ILoveNetworkSystems!

All Code is written in C.
Server was built off the example echo server provided.
