# NetworkSystems_Fall2019
A collection of assignments I completed for the Network Systems Class in Fall 2019. Please do not use or reproduce this code without my consent, and using this code for your own class is a violation of the Honor Code.


I do not permit anyone in the CSCI 4273 Network Systems Class at CU Boulder to utlize and copy this code, nor do I endorse there actions if they are found to do so. I have placed these files in a public repo for reference for potential employers and others interesed in the various assignments.
